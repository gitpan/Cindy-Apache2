<h2>ESTool kills raid superblock</h2>

<i>Hopefully useful information, use at your own risk</i>

<h3>The Event</h3>
<p>When one of my 2 samsung disks reported a "Offline uncorrectable"
I had the idea I should use 
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/hdd/support/utilities/ES_Tool.html"
>samsungs estool</a> to check and possibly
repair my disk. It came with a comfortable bootable cd image and 
worked straight forward. So I checked both disks which were reported 
OK. The major amount of space on these disks is used for an md raid1
(md1 on sda3, sdb3) which holds the home directories. I rebooted and 
said raid1 was gone.
</p>

<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p>Rereading the text on the download page revealed that estool actually
does write tests. In addition google told me that such an event 
<a href="http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/raid5-verschwunden/"
  >had happened before</a>. It seems that estool
implements the idea that some space beginning of the the 3rd
partion is unused. 
</p>

<h3>Recovery</h3>
<p>When I took a closer look at my system I found it was actualy working.
On top of my /dev/md1 sits LVM2. Lvm had discovered sda3 and as sdb3 as
identical physical volumes and had used one of them. Since it lookded 
as if the data was still OK I started recreating the raid superblock. 
<code>mdadm --create</code> only creates the superblock while leavin the
content intact, so I did a
</p><pre>
mdadm --create /dev/md1 --assume-clean --level=raid1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda3 missing
</pre><p> 
on the disk that had not been used by lvm. Note that 
<code>--assume-clean</code> is probably not necessary, but thats what 
I did. After fscking the recreated 
md device I added the second device to the array.
</p><pre>
mdadm --manage --add /dev/md1 /dev/sdb3
</pre><p>
This of course triggered a resync. Since the other disk had been
in use in between this was unavoidable.
